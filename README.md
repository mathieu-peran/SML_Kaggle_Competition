# SML_Kaggle_Competition

This in-class Kaggle data science competition is organized for the MSc Big Data students in the 2023-2024 batch, for solely academic purpose. The competition is completely adapted from the ongoing competition on Trustii.io [1].

In this competition, the students will work on an open data set extracted from Alim'confiance, containing the results of official sanitary controls on food safety carried out in all establishments of the food chain in France in 2023-2024 [2]. The goal of the challenge is to build the best machine learning model that can predict the food sanitary quality of the establishments as accurate as possible.

Finally and importantly, students are encouraged to incorporate other open data (e.g., weather, news, etc.) to boost the machine learning models.

This competition ends on: 11:59pm, 18 April 2024 (Paris Time, GMT+1).
